# YAML Parsing

### Needed functions

1. Create yaml files
2. Read and store yaml files in golang variables
3. Create hyperspace, fabric, and kubernetes configurations
4. Own package
5. Dynamically read, update, and write yaml files, objects, and
   file-objects

### Goals

1. Read in yaml file and store to a golang variable

2. Modify that golang struct and write its output

### DoD

1. I can read in a hyperspace network configuration, from it, create  4
   hyperspace configurations (peerX2, orderer, configtx) as well as the
   needed fabric configurations (core, orderer,  configtx)

   the fabric configurations will be auto-generated by golang default
   variables. these variables should be versioned and ordered
   accordingly
