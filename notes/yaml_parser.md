# YAML Parsing

### Needed functions

1. Create yaml files
2. Read and store yaml files in golang variables
3. Create hyperspace, fabric, and kubernetes configurations
4. Own package
5. Dynamically read, update, and write yaml files, objects, and
   file-objects

### Goals

1. Read in yaml file and store to a golang variable

2. Modify that golang struct and write its output

### New Considerations (1.10.21)

   - I cannot use viper to read and write configs for two reasons
      - it's write (save-as) outputs keys in all lowercase
      - not knowing which config variables will be overridden, I'd be a
        hassle to have to read in each field from one config and write
        it to another... goal would be to have two structs I can merge

   - I cannot read in a yaml file and preserve anchors and dumps
   
**Current working idea: **

   - Read in hyperspace_network_config.yaml with a viper
      - for each node and top-level configuration
         - load Config into structs
   - Read/load default fabric configs into structs (where are these
     stored?)
   - Merge related structs (go-yaml?)
   - Write structs as fabric config yaml files (go-yaml)
   
** More things to note: **

    - I need to generate hyperspace.yaml(s) as well as the templates
    - the hys_net_config will generate pre-filled fabric configurations
        - I will generate the hyperspace configs with the rest of the info
            specified. This info is needed by MIND to run the binaries. 
            - the fabric configs are just needed by the configs
            - where should overrides be set? hyperspace or fabric?
            - Should hyperspace configs be used to set fabric configs?
                - or should that just always be done in the fabric configs

### DoD

1. I can read in a hyperspace network configuration, from it, create  4
   hyperspace configurations (peerX2, orderer, configtx) as well as the
   needed fabric configurations (core, orderer,  configtx)

   the fabric configurations will be auto-generated by golang default
   variables. these variables should be versioned and ordered
   accordingly
