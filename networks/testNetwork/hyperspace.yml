# Hyperspace Network Configuration

# Path to Hyperspace cmdscript. Should this path be
# relative to the cmdscripts directory?
# that way I can just list the file-name here...
scriptPath: "../../cmdscripts/spawn-node.sh"

# define which nodes you want as part of your network here
# nodes.peer and nodes.orderer are needed paths
# the values underneath the keys are the names of
# the nodes which should match the directory names
# found under nodes/peers and nodes/orderers
# (fyi: "peer" and "orderer" are singular here
# because that's the binary name. They are plural
# in the directory tree (node/[peers/orderers]) because
# there are multiple instances of that single binary...
# and because I just happened to name it that way.
# maybe just standardize to singular... nah
nodes:
  peer:
    - peer-01
    - peer-01
  orderer:
    - orderer-01
