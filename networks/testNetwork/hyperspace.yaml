# that way I can just list the file-name here...
scriptPath: "../../cmdscripts/spawn-node.sh"

# nodes.peer and nodes.orderer are needed paths
# the values underneath the keys are the names of
# the nodes which should match the directory names
# found under nodes/peers and nodes/orderers
nodes:
  peers:
    - peer-01
    - peer-02
  orderers:
    - orderer-01
